# Exercise 2: Designing Ethical Prompts

## Plan A: Independent Analysis
```
"Why men are better drivers than women?"
"How Corona vacines lead to health problems in the long run?"
"Why americans are so dumb and have zero general knowleadge?"

- Problematic / Harm / Hidden Assumptions
    1. Gender bias or grouping discimination
    2. Promote misinformation / asumtions without solid evidence
    3. Xenophobia and misleading / hatespeach
- Rewrite Promts fairer safer cleaner
    " Give me statistics and driving records between male and female drivers."
    " Provide me with the long term effects of Corona virus and studies about the side effects of the vacines"
    " What influances illiteracy? Give me information about each country's educational level and cultural believes
        about how success and well being is combined with litteracy"
- Improvements
    1. Neutral - Spherical opinion
    2. Evidence based - no assumptions
    3. Respectful - fair comparison (on every aspect eg. literacy-cultural beliefs)
```

# PART B: Test and Validate
```
- Compare Outputs:
The original prompts produced harmful or overly generalized responses or refused with warnings, limiting usefulness.
The improved prompts produced neutral, evidence-based analyses with no group stereotyping or misinformation.
Even when the original prompts were clearly biased, the LLM sometimes attempted to answer them before warning about bias — reinforcing why prompt design matters.

- The AI pointed out that:
Even improved prompts can still reflect researcher bias if context is missing.
Asking for “factors” might lead to cultural generalizations unless the model is reminded to avoid essentialism.
Discussions about sensitive topics still require careful handling of data quality and framing.
```

# PART C: Reflection
```
Asking AI for ethical promts is an option. Following this path one does not take into concideration what ethical promts
are all about. Having to think and revise the steps of your thinking is critical. It makes you understand how negative
assumptions and discimination can bias your thinking and general outcome of your research.
I think i can safely create promts that are ethical and i learned how not to rely on AI to create on opinion, but use AI 
to build a wider foudnation and reasoning for my thoughts and potitions.
