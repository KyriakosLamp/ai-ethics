# Exercise 3: Detecting and Mitigating Harmful Outputs

## Part A: Safety Analysis
```
The other day i was about to buy mesh coils for my ecigaret. I was ready to place the coils i wanted in my cart
when i realised there are 2 kinds of coils. I used AI to find out which one i was using already. Grok told me 
inaccurate information. I asked about the 0.4 OHMs coils on what wattage are they efficient and it gave me wrong information, AI told me that it works efficiently on 20-30 watts and the sweet spot is 25. I thought that was 
wrong so i checked the actual device and coil i had in my hands and the manual and i found out that that range was
for the 0.2 OHMs coil and the correct values for the 0.4 OHM was 50-60 watts. I searched for it on forums, sites and 
manuals and it turned out that my fears were correct. AI gave me wrong information.
```
## Part B: Strategic AI use
```
I redid the test and the same result appeared, "what is the wattage of 0.4 ohms mesh coil for zeus ecig?", same wrong
results appeared 20-30 watts. i asked that specific ai to make more research and make sure that the results are acurate,
visit more sites read official manuals wherever it can find them and make sure that the manufacturer specificaly say the 0.4 and not the 0.2 omhs coil. AI apologised and gave me the correct result. If i wasnt familiar with that topic the
wrong information it gave me the first time whould taken for granted becouse of how sure and professional it sounded.
```
## Part C: Reflection
```
This exercise made me realise that AI is not perfect and can give wrong information. It also made
me understand that i have to be carefull when using AI for information gathering and fact checking.
Even if the AI sounds sure and professional it can be wrong. I have to make sure that i crosscheck
the information i get from AI with other sources and not take it for granted.
